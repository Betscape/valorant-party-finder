# Valorant Party Finder Website Documentation

## Document Information
- **Title:** Valorant Party Finder - Comprehensive System Documentation
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** September 30, 2025
- **Author:** Grok 4 (xAI Assistant)
- **Purpose:** This document provides a detailed, professional blueprint for developing, implementing, and maintaining the "Valorant Party Finder" (VPF) website. It encompasses the conceptual overview, functional specifications, user interface designs, technical architecture, security considerations, and deployment strategies. This is derived from the initial concept of a community platform to facilitate Valorant player matchmaking via party codes and LFG (Looking for Group) requests.
- **Audience:** Developers, designers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in building or evaluating the VPF platform.
- **Assumptions:** The platform targets Valorant players familiar with Riot Games' mechanics. Development assumes a modern web stack (e.g., React/Next.js frontend, Node.js backend, Firebase or MongoDB for database). No prior Riot API integration is assumed, as the system relies on user-submitted data.

## Executive Summary
Valorant Party Finder (VPF) is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of finding and joining Valorant parties. By leveraging Valorant's built-in party code system and user-submitted LFG requests, VPF addresses common pain points in solo queuing, such as mismatched ranks, regions, or playstyles. The platform features real-time posting, advanced filtering, and safety tools to foster a positive community.

Key highlights:
- **Core Functionality:** Users create/browse party invites with codes or LFG requests with usernames.
- **Enhancements:** Auto-expiration, tags, analytics, and moderation for usability and safety.
- **Technical Feasibility:** Built on scalable web technologies; MVP deployable in weeks.
- **Business Value:** Free core service with premium upsell potential; community-driven growth via social sharing.

This documentation serves as a complete guide, ensuring the platform is robust, user-friendly, and aligned with Valorant's ecosystem.

## Introduction

### Project Background
Valorant, a tactical FPS by Riot Games, allows players to queue in parties of 1-5 via the in-game client. Party codes enable quick joins without friending, but finding compatible players often requires external tools like Discord or Reddit. VPF centralizes this into a dedicated website, reducing friction and enhancing matchmaking.

The concept evolved from user frustration with solo/duo queuing, proposing a bulletin-board style site for invites and requests. It respects Valorant's rules (e.g., no 4-stacks in ranked) and promotes positive interactions.

### Objectives
- Provide a seamless way to share/join parties using Valorant codes.
- Enable solo players to advertise availability for invites.
- Incorporate filters, real-time updates, and safety features.
- Ensure scalability for peak gaming hours (e.g., evenings/weekends).
- Maintain compliance with Riot's terms and data privacy laws.

### Scope
- Web application with 7 core pages.
- User accounts for posting/editing.
- Real-time data syncing.
- Basic moderation tools.
- Integration with social sharing (e.g., Twitter/X).

### Out-of-Scope
- Mobile app (focus on responsive web).
- Direct Riot API integration (user-submitted data only).
- In-platform voice/video chat (use Valorant's built-in).
- Advanced ML matching (initially rule-based filters).

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration/Login:** Email or Riot ID OAuth; guest browsing.
2. **Post Creation:** Forms for party invites (with code) and LFG requests (with username).
3. **Browsing and Filtering:** Searchable lists with real-time updates.
4. **Interactions:** Copy codes/usernames; react/report posts.
5. **Management:** Dashboard for post editing, analytics.
6. **Expiration:** Auto-remove stale posts (e.g., 30min for codes).
7. **Notifications:** Email/DM for reactions or joins (optional premium).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Page loads <2s; handle 10k concurrent users.
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime; CDN for static assets.
- **Security:** HTTPS; input sanitization; CAPTCHA on posts.
- **Scalability:** Cloud-based (e.g., AWS/GCP) with auto-scaling.
- **Compatibility:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox); mobile-first design.

### User Roles
- **Guest:** Browse only.
- **Registered User:** Post, edit, dashboard access.
- **Moderator/Admin:** Review reports, ban users (future expansion).

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Design
VPF follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend:** SPA (Single Page Application) for dynamic UI.
- **Backend:** RESTful API for CRUD operations on posts.
- **Database:** NoSQL (e.g., Firestore) for flexible schemas.
- **Real-Time:** WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) for live feeds.
- **Flow:** User → Frontend → API → DB; push updates via sockets.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js/Next.js, Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB or Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Auth:** JWT or Firebase Auth.
- **Deployment:** Vercel/Netlify for frontend; Heroku/AWS for backend.
- **Other:** Redis for caching; Cloudinary for image uploads (e.g., rank proofs).

### Data Models
- **PartyInvite Schema:**
  - id: String (UUID)
  - userId: String
  - size: Enum (Solo, Duo, Trio, FourStack)
  - region: String
  - rank: String
  - mode: Enum (Ranked, Unrated, etc.)
  - code: String (validated format)
  - description: String
  - tags: Array<String>
  - createdAt: Date
  - expiresAt: Date (default +30min)
  - views: Number
  - status: Enum (Active, Expired)

- **LFGRequest Schema:** Similar, but with username instead of code; expiresAt +1hr.

- **User Schema:** id, email, riotId, bio, verified: Boolean, blocked: Array<UserId>.

### Integration Points
- Social Sharing: Twitter/X API for auto-tweets.
- Email: SendGrid for notifications.
- Analytics: Google Analytics for usage tracking.
